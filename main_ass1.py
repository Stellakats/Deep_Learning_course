    First, training, test and validation sets are loaded.
    Then, various experiments are conducted so as to test the network's performance.
    The flags below enable different experiments:
    exp0: This compares the gradients computed analytically in this assignment, against a numerical gradient
    computation method: centered_diff or  finite_diff (which is faster than the first but less accurate). It then plots
    the analytical and numerical grads for visual inspection purposes.
    exp1: Tests the net's performance for learning rate=0.01 and 位=0 and plots the weight vector of the 1st class.
    exp2: Tests the net's performance for learning rate=0.1 and 位=0 and plots the weight vector of the 1st class.
    exp3: Tests the net's performance for learning rate=0.01 and 位=0.1 and plots the weight vector of the 1st class.
    exp4: Tests the net's performance for learning rate=0.01 and 位=1 and plots the weight vector of the 1st class.
    exp5: Plots the weight vectors of all classes, for the optimum set parameters.
